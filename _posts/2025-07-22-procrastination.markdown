We encode laborious chores in a new type of game, the **labour game**, and analyze how agents behave when they are disincentivized to contribute but incentivized towards completion. This closely mimics scenarios like group projects, house cleaning, and other human-human tasks. We find the emergence of a phenomenon like procrastination, and define rules that govern an agent's behaviour in this game.
